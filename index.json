KG completion is the problem of answering queries of the type (e, r, ?) i.e. given a query entity e and query relation r, find the entity e_ans that has the relation r with e. As you can imagine, this task is used to complete partial KGs by guessing missing edges.\nGiven a new problem, a Case-based Reasoning system:\n Retrieves similar cases seem in the past Reuses solutions to previously solved cases Revises solutions to apply to the current query Retains modified solutions as new cases  We adapt this system for knowledge graph completion by using the training graph as the store of solved cases. Similar entities are found by nearest neighbors using a simple one-hot representation based on connected relations (this captures the notion of entity types). Solutions are paths (sequence of relations) that reach the answer node. Then starting from the query entity, we traverse the graph using the paths collected. If such a system can achieve high accuracy, it is appealing owing to its simplicity, interpretability, and scalability.\nWe demonstrated that this simple system is highly performant in A Simple Approach to Case-Based Reasoning in Knowledge Bases.\nAfter performing an error analysis on this system, we then imposed a probabilistic structure to allow the system to weight the answers. Concretely, we use the prior probability of a path reaching the tail entity for the given query relation and the precision of that path type to downweight spurious paths. We use clustering to help aggregate probabilitities. We demonstrated in Probabilistic Case-based Reasoning for Open-World Knowledge Graph Completion that this systems matches/outperforms baselines on FB122, WN18RR and Nell-995. Moreover, we demonstrated that this method can be applied to dynamic growing KGs with minimal overhead whereas the best embedding based methods deteriorate with successive KG updates.\nFuture Work: We are experimenting with extending this reasoning strategy to question answering systems. A lot of challenges arise with moving from the structured world of knowledge graphs to unstructured text.\n","date":1602979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602979200,"objectID":"832ab6457a99560ddb551650a90ccc3c","permalink":"https://ameyagodbole.github.io/project/case-based-reasoning/","publishdate":"2020-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/case-based-reasoning/","section":"project","summary":"Applied CBR to knowledge graph completition with competitive results.

If such a system can achieve high accuracy, it is appealing owing to its simplicity, interpretability, and scalability.

Our approach predicts attributes for an entity by gathering reasoning paths from similar entities in the KB. Our probabilistic model estimates the likelihood that a path is effective at answering a query about the given entity. The parameters of our model can be efficiently computed using simple path statistics and require no iterative optimization. Our model is non-parametric, growing dynamically as new entities and relations are added to the KB. On several benchmark datasets our approach significantly outperforms other rule learning approaches and performs comparably to state-of-the-art embedding-based approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in an 'open-world' setting where new entities arrive in an online fashion, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches and nearly matching the best offline method.","tags":["KBC","CBR"],"title":"Probabilistic Case-based Reasoning for Open-World Knowledge Graph Completion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajarshi Das","Ameya Godbole","Shehzaad Dhuliawala","Manzil Zaheer","Andrew McCallum"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592956800,"objectID":"e451b7e0c868e767330b26962942a56f","permalink":"https://ameyagodbole.github.io/publication/a-simple-approach-to-case-based-reasoning-in-knowledge-bases/","publishdate":"2020-11-02T14:13:23-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/a-simple-approach-to-case-based-reasoning-in-knowledge-bases/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a surprisingly simple yet accurate approach to reasoning in knowledge graphs (KGs) that requires *no training*, and is reminiscent of case-based reasoning in classical artificial intelligence (AI).

In particular, given a time-varying pricing and demand function for electricity and the ability to store a limited amount of electricity for future use (inventory), the task is to minimize the cost of buying electricity while meeting the demand at every time instant.\nThe existing state-of-the-art techniques [1] propose a behavior rule that is analytically shown to have the lowest possible worst case cost ratio. The authors have shown that the method also works well in the average case against several competitive baselines. However, this rule based method does not learn or adapt to the distributions of price and demand. This project attempted to develop methods using Reinforcement Learning to see whether there is room for improvement by learning from interactions with this environment.\nAfter setting up the RL problem with the price and demand variations as the environment and the battery control as the agent, I applied a range of standard RL algorithms as well as imitation learning (DAGGER [2]). The oracle for imitation learning was the optimal offline solution.\nOutcomes: The RL methods are difficult to train for this problem and even with hyperparameter tuning, the best performing agents cannot beat the SotA baseline. The imitation learning agent fares better than the RL agents ans is competitive with the SotA (but not better).\nI ended the project by outlining avenues for future work including dynamically changing action spaces and two-stage control.

This motivated us to propose a progressively balanced neural tree where training dataset are balanced prior to perceptron learning. The second contribution is the optimization of the decision function with respect to entropy impurity based objective functions.
