Existing works in this area have mostly focused on C4.5 trees that learn axis aligned partitions. On the other hand, neural trees learn oblique partitions from data and use lesser number of decision nodes hosting perceptrons. However, these perceptrons are susceptible to data imbalances. This motivated us to propose a progressively balanced neural tree where training dataset are balanced prior to perceptron learning. The second contribution is the optimization of the decision function with respect to entropy impurity based objective functions. This formulation also allows a parent node to have more than two child nodes. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked on ten standard datasets against three baseline multi-class classification algorithms.","tags":["decision trees","ML","classification"],"title":"Progressively Balanced Multi-class Neural Trees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ameya Godbole","Aman Dalmia","Sunil Kumar Sahu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517115600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517115600,"objectID":"c18a00055f73a8b761cf84e34586b3f1","permalink":"https://ameyagodbole.github.io/publication/quora_question_pairs/","publishdate":"2018-01-28T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/quora_question_pairs/","section":"publication","summary":"Determining whether two given questions are semantically similar is a fairly challenging task given the different structures and forms that the questions can take. In this paper, we use Gated Recurrent Units(GRU) in combination with other highly used machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Adaboost and SVM for the similarity prediction task on a dataset released by Quora, consisting of about 400k labeled question pairs. We got the best result by using the Siamese adaptation of a Bidirectional GRU with a Random Forest classifier, which landed us among the top 24% in the competition Quora Question Pairs hosted on Kaggle.","tags":["NLP","ensemble","GRU","RNN"],"title":"Siamese Neural Networks with Random Forest for detecting duplicate question pairs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Mentor: Dr. Prithwijit Guha (Dept. of EEE, IIT Guwahati)\nCollaborator: Spoorthy Bhat\nThis project was my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s thesis at IIT Guwahati.\nThe basic idea is to allow each node to learn oblique partitions in the input space as opposed to the axis-aligned partitions learned by a standard C4.5 tree. This required the development of a differentiable criterion.\nDuring the course of the project we realized that this hierarchical partitioning results in data-thinning (i.e. as we go down the tree, the number of samples reaching a node go on decreasing). This causes the trained nodes to be biased when class distributions become unbalanced. Consequently, we resort to data balancing. We tested different methods of artificially balancing the class distribution in the data at each node.\nOur method gave comparable accuracy to existing classifiers on 10 benchmark datasets. What is the gain? The learned trees require fewer computations at test time (on average over the test set) than a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) of comparable accuracy.\nWe designed the framework for training the decision tree and node parameters, and testing the classifier using the Tensorflow package.\n","date":1501560000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501560000,"objectID":"ec957e36c51ce7376d8c8e708d406f6c","permalink":"https://ameyagodbole.github.io/project/progressively_balanced_multiclass_neural_trees/","publishdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/progressively_balanced_multiclass_neural_trees/","section":"project","summary":"Proposed and tested an entropy impurity based objective function for incorporating a learnable perceptron into the decision tree framework.
