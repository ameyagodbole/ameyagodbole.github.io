      <description>The Robotics Club of IIT Guwahati developed this project. The aim was to learn on the go which was facilitated through tutorials by senior members of the club and the institute as a whole. The project resulted in a robot that could:
 Map its environment and create a 3D rendering of the world using a stereo-camera (which provided depth information). We later migrated to the Kinect sensor Localize itself in a known map upon initialization Navigate to a given target location (set in the map)  The software was built on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS) which provide packages for handling all the concurrent processes.</description>
